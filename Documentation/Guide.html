<a name="S_introduction"><h1>1. Introduction</h1></a>

<p>Joy is an integration of a lexer generator based on transition-augmented
deterministic finite automata without backtracking, and a parser generator using
shift-reduce with a table produced by a hybrid of the LALR(1) algorithm with flexible
lookahead so that it is able to process LALR(k) grammars.  It features a backend
targeting Haskell, and is itself written in Haskell.</p>


<a name="S_introduction_downloads"><h2>1.1. Downloads</h2></a>

<p>Joy is packaged with Haskell's Cabal packaging system, and can be cabal-installed
with the command:</p>

<div class="command">cabal install joy</div>

<p>Unreleased versions of it are available through Darcs, and can be obtained with
the command:</p>

<div class="command">darcs get <a href="http://dankna.com/software/darcs/Joy/">http://dankna.com/software/darcs/Joy/</a></div>

<p>Precompiled binaries are not available at this time.</p>

<p>The intention of this licensing is to make Joy suitable for both commercial and
noncommercial projects, and to allow free modification of it by anybody.  Note, however,
that as a personal request from me the developer, I ask that you not use the Joy name if
you create your own version.  I have not formally trademarked it, but it would be poor
form.</p>

<a name="S_introduction_organization"><h2>1.3. Organization of this Manual</h2></a>

<p>This manual is divided into this introductory chapter, the semantics chapter,
and one chapter for each backend of Joy.  Each backend chapter has its own tutorial and
reference sections.  There is significant duplication between chapters; in particular,
the repertoire of sample programs is the same in each to the extent that this makes
sense.  The thinking is that this allows you to pretend that Joy is written only for
your favorite language, with examples which need not be converted in your head because
they are already written for that language.</p>

<p>You should feel free to ignore the chapters which do not pertain to you.</p>


<a name="S_semantics"><h1>2. Semantics</h1></a>

<p>Joy is an integrated lexer/parser generator.  What this means is that Joy can
generate any number of lexers as well as any number of parsers from the same input
file.  The use of a single input file avoids the traditional need of Yacc to run after
Lex so that the list of token values can be provided, or the alternate need to construct
the list of tokens separately and maintain it by hand.</p>

<p>It is often useful to define multiple lexers, say for different contexts of the same
grammar; there is an inheritance facility provided so that one lexer can be based on
another but add additional expressions.  There is no facility to unlist expressions in
an inheriting lexer, but this can be simulated by adding a common parent which contains
a subset of the expressions.</p>

<p>It is also useful to define multiple parsers on the same grammar, say one for
statements and one for expressions, or perhaps both for the same construct but one
preserving whitespace and one not.  For this reason the <span class="CODE">PARSER</span>
declaration attaches to a nonterminal definition rather than being in the header of
the input file.  This substantially reduces repetition when there are many parsers, and
is also clearer to read.</p>


<a name="S_semantics_lexing"><h1>2.1. Lexing</h1></a>

<p>The lexical-analysis part of Joy is based on transition-augmented deterministic
finite automata without backtracking, as described in
<a href="#S_bibliography_laurikari2000">[laurikari2000]</a> and
<a href="#S_bibliography_laurikari2001">[laurikari2001]</a>.  It also implements
positive- and negative- lookahead and lookbehind assertions, as described in
<a href="#S_bibliography_becchi_crowley2008">[becchi-crowley2008]</a>.  The integration
of Laurikari's strategy using TDFAs without backtracking with Becchi and Crowley's
assertions, which they define in terms of epsilon-NFAs with backtracking, is original
research performed by me, and is unpublished.  Interested readers are referred to the
source code.</p>

<p>The fact that the lexer doesn't backtrack means that it can lex any regular
expression.  For example, Perl places the restriction that you can't do
<span class="code">(a*)*</span> because this would have exponential complexity.  Joy,
however, handles it just fine, in the same linear complexity as it handles anything
else.  It is also the case that Perl and PCRE have worse-than-linear complexity in both
space and time as the size of the regular expression grows; in contrast, Joy's algorithm
can handle very large expressions.  Joy is not the only regular expression engine to
use this linear-time algorithm, but it is the only one I am aware of which acts as a
full lexical analyzer, processing multiple expressions to break input into a series of
tokens.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that this versatility creates ambiguity:  Of the many possible
ways for a given regular expression to match a given string, which do we choose?  The
lexer uses three rules to resolve this:<p>

<dl>
<dt>Leftmost longest</dt>
<dd>Prefer matches starting earlier in the string.  Of all which are still tied among
these, prefer matches ending later in the string.  This rule applies both to each
expression as a whole, and to each subexpression.  A match against the empty string
is still a match, and is preferred over no match at all.</dd>
<dt>Earlier subexpressions</dt>
<dd>Prefer subexpressions starting earlier in the expression over ones starting later.
Prefer parent subexpressions over their children.</dd>
<dt>Last repeated match</dt>
<dd>When a given subexpression matches multiple times in the same string, prefer the
last match.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, consider matching <span class="code">(a*)</span> against
<span class="code">aaa</span>.  There are ten possible substrings which could be
matched: the empty string at four different positions; the string
<span class="code">a</span> at three different positions; the string
<span class="code">aa</span> at two different positions; and the entire string
<span class="code">aaa</span>.  Of all these, we note that the earliest offset at which
a match is possible is the very beginning of the string.  By the "leftmost" part of
leftmost-longest, we narrow our candidates to just four.  Of these we note that the
greatest length posible is the entire string.  By the "longest" part, we narrow our
candidates to one.</p>

<p>Now consider matching <span class="code">(a*)(a*)</span> against
that same input <span class="code">aaa</span>.  There are the same ten possible
substrings for the entire expression to match.  By the same process as above, we
determine that we will match the entire string.  But this says nothing about which
subexpression will match which part of it!  There are still four possible ways we could
match:
(empty, <span class="code">aaa</span>),
(<span class="code">a</span>, <span class="code">aa</span>),
(<span class="code">aa</span>, <span class="code">a</span>),
(<span class="code">aaa</span>, empty).
By the "earlier subexpressions" rule, we know that the first
<span class="code">(a*)</span> takes precedence over the second.  Thus we choose the
last of these possibilities.</p>

<p>Finally, consider matching <span class="code">(a|a*)*</span> against, again, the
input <span class="code">aaa</span>.  By the leftmost-longest rule, we know that we will
match the entire string.  By the subexpression rule, we know that we will match
<span class="code">a</span> in preference to <span class="code">a*</span>.  But in
that case, we match the subexpression three times - once for each character.  What
portion of the input do we bind the captured variable to?  It would be sensible to
choose the first match, or the last match, or even to return a list of all matches.
What we do is choose the last match, matching against the third instance of
<span class="code">a</span>.  This is the last-repeated-match rule.</p>
